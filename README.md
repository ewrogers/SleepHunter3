# SleepHunter (v3)

Dark Ages Automation Tool

This is the third version of SleepHunter, the predecessor to [SleepHunter 4](https://github.com/ewrogers/SleepHunter4).

The code was lost in time, but fortunately it was compiled with Debug information and able to be exported via
[dotPeek](https://www.jetbrains.com/decompiler/) while retaining most, if not all, of the code itself.

Currently, it does not work with the latest client 7.41 but it should be possible to get it working.
