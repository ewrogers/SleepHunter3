## [3.1.0] - 10-26-2025

This is the first release of the **Revived Edition**.
It is a complete re-write of the SleepHunter macro engine, with many new features and improvements.
This allows a much more extensible and powerful system that can be used to create new macros.

It keeps the original user interface with some quality of life improvements, additional validation, context menus,
and tons of optimizations for performance/memory usage.

It has been updated to support the latest Dark Ages Client version (7.41).
Both original SleepHunter macro files (`*.sh3`) and the new SleepHunter extended macro files (`*.sh3x`) are supported.
